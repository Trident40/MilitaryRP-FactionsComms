# MilitaryRP-FactionsComms
[Why the release]
I’ve been lurking around the forums for a couple months just tinkering with different resources and checking out all the great new resources, I thought it was about time to begin contributing to the community on modifications or the little stuff I’ve put together over the last couple months.
